# Prediction of Price of Used Cars

Driverless cars are getting closer to reality and at a faster pace than ever. But it is still a bit far fetched dream to have one in your garage. For the time being, there are still a lot of combustion and hybrid cars that roar around the road, for some it chills. Though the overall data on sales of automobiles shows a huge drop in sales in the last couple of years, cars are still a big attraction for many. Cars are more than just a utility for many. They are often the pride and status of the family. We all have different tastes when it comes to owning a car or at least when thinking of owning one.

### In this project I have predicted the price of used cars and ranked 41 in the MachineHack Competition.
